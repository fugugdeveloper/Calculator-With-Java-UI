# ðŸ§® Java RMI-Based Calculator (2018 Class Project)

A simple calculator application built as a class project in 2018 using **Java Swing (JFrame)** for the graphical user interface and **Java RMI (Remote Method Invocation)** for remote computation.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Description

This project showcases how to combine **Java GUI (Swing)** with **Java RMI** to build a distributed calculator application. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations via a graphical interface, while computations are handled remotely by an RMI server.

Originally created for an academic assignment, it demonstrates key Java concepts such as:

- GUI development with Swing
- Remote communication using RMI
- Separation of interface, client, and server logic

---

## ðŸ’¡ Features

- Interactive calculator GUI (buttons, input panel)
- Supports basic operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division
- RMI-based server-client architecture
- Clean and modular code structure
